Description and Agenda for
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
Infrastructure Architecture Workshop

Description:

The purpose of this training is to show attendees the benefits, the architecture, the installation and the operational management of Red Hat´s Container Plattform „OpenShift“
Attendees learn during these two days how to present, design and architect an OpenShift installation on-premise and to install it different public clouds.

The main focus is on the infrastructure of OpenShift there is only very little development in this training.

This WorkShop covers:

Architecture, Installation, Management, Networking, Storage, Container Runtime Features (CRY-O) modern registry implementation (QUAY) , Virtualization (CNV), running on different HW Platforms (Power), running different Solutions (IBM Products on OCP)

Prerequisites:

Basic understanding of Linux, containers (Docker), networking,
A notebook with a browser

Expected results

After attending this workshop you know how to architect and install an OpenShift environment, explain CRI-O, Istio and other “state of the art” tools to manage and meter OpenShift.
Explain the integration of development tools, the options and how to install applications from other vendors on OpenShift (IBM, SAP,….)
